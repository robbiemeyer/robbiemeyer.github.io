In September 2018, I participated in Hack the North. Kik created a data science
challenge for the hackathon that my group decided to attempt. We were provided
with a large dataset of high dimensional data. About 98% of the of the data was
labelled as good (regular users) and the remaining 2% of the data was labelled
as bad (spammers). Each data point had over 75 unidentified numerical features.
The challenge was to figure out how to identify which data points were bad for
a similar dataset without the good/bad labels.

I had a fantastic time working on this problem with my team. The problem was
interesting, I learned a lot and had fun doing it. We ended up creating a
solution that was able to identify the spammers with 99.98% accuracy and won
the challenge.
